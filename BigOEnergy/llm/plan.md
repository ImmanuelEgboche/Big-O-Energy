Next Steps Overview:
Step 1: Data Loader (src/data_loader.py)

Reads your train/val/test files
Converts conversations to tokens (numbers the model understands)
Creates batches for efficient training

Step 2: Model Setup (src/model.py)

Loads GPT-2 base model
Sets up tokenizer
Prepares model for fine-tuning

Step 3: Training Script (scripts/train_model.py)

Main training loop
Feeds data to model, calculates loss, updates weights
Saves checkpoints during training
Takes ~2-4 hours with 1000 conversations

Step 4: Evaluation (scripts/evaluate.py)

Tests your trained model on test set
Measures how good the recommendations are
Generates sample outputs

Step 5: Demo (scripts/demo.py)

Interactive chat interface
"What anime should I watch if I liked Naruto?"
Shows off your model for portfolio

Training Process:

Model reads conversation
Predicts next word
Compares to actual next word
Adjusts to be more accurate
Repeat 1000s of times until it "learns" anime recommendations

End Result: Your own anime recommendation AI that you trained from scratch!
