# Minimum Stack

This is a classic medium level question as it tracks two things at once
- Can you think beyond the obvious answer
- Can i design a auxiliary data structure to get teh disired time complexity

**The real issue here is that becaseu of the O(1) required for all functions it affects all the otehr functions**

Because how do I get minat any point without re-scanning the stack every time?

**Two Stacks**

### WHy two stacks

- The stack is the main part which holds the data we're actually working with 

- teh minStack in this case or whatever it would be in another case is a running lig of what the minimum at each point in the array 

### How do i get there in a interview

- Pattern recognition

- Knowing the trick from similar problems
