💡 A. Tech Round (Usually 30–60 mins)

"Walk me through your data pipeline"

"How would you debug a failed SSRS report?"

"How do you manage version control for reports or data models?"

"How would you migrate from SQL Server to cloud?"

"How do you handle orchestration?"

"What are the bottlenecks in a linked-server setup?"

"Can you explain your Rust sidecar architecture?"

Depending on the role, you might also get:

SQL test (moderate complexity, joins, CTEs, window functions)

Scripting challenge (small Python exercise)

Infra/design question (e.g. "Design a data pipeline to pull NHS stats hourly and serve an API")

💡 B. Delivery Round (Behavioral & Project Experience)

“How did you deal with stakeholders not trusting your reports?”

“Give an example of when you reduced report latency.”

“How did you ensure data quality in production?”

“What’s the biggest system you’ve debugged under pressure?”

💡 C. Curveballs for £500+/day

“How would you estimate the value you provided on X project?”

“How comfortable are you being thrown into a half-built pipeline?”

“How do you document data flows for handover?”

“How do you guarantee reproducibility in automation?”
